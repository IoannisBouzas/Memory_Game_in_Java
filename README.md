# Memory-Game-in-Java
This game was the first assignment in my OOP course in the second semester of my computer science degree. For this exercise I had to implement a simple version of the well-known board game memory. In this game there are 2*N cards that form N pairs of pictures. The cards are placed face down in a random order on the table. In each round each player turns over two of the cards. If the cards are identical the player collects the cards and wins a point. The cards are removed from the table. Otherwise the cards are closed and the next player continues. The game ends when all pairs have been found. The player who has accumulated the most points wins. In the simplified version that you will implement, instead of pairs of cards with pictures, we will have N pairs with numbers from 0 to N-1. Below, whenever we talk about "cards" we will mean the numbers 0...N-1. Each number appears twice. The cards will be placed randomly on a line. The game will be played either between a human player and a computer player, or between two human players. In each round the human player chooses the two cards to be turned over at the same time (i.e. he chooses the second card before turning over the first). The human player chooses two cards using a tactic described below. For your implementation you will need to create four classes. The Board class which holds 
information about the "table" and the "cards". The ComputerPlayer class which implements the player's computer game. The HumanPlayer class that implements the human player's game. The MemoryGame class that implements the game flow
